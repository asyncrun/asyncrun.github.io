SQL Tutoril

SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data
in databass.

Our SQL Tutorial will teach you how to use SQL in: MySQL, SQL Server, MS Access,
Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres, and other database systems.

Examples in Each Chapter
With our online SQL editor, you can edit the SQL statements, and click on a button
to view the result.

Exmple
SELECT * FROM Customers;

Introduction to SQL
SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.


What is SQL?
* SQL stands for Structured Query Language
* SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
* SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute(ANSI) 
  in 1986, and of the international Organization for Standardization(ISO)
  in 1987.
  
What Can SQL do?
* SQL can execute queries against a database
* SQL can retrieve data from a database
* SQL can insert records in a database
* SQL can update records in a database
* SQL can delete records from a database
* SQL can create new databases
* SQL can create new tables in a database
* SQL can create stored procedures in a database
* SQL can create vies in a database
* SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views



SQL is a Standard - BUT...
Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL
language.

However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the
major commands(such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE)in a similar manner.

Note: Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions
in addition to the SQL standard!

Using SQL in your Web Site
To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:
* An (relational database management system) RDBMS database rpogram(i.e. MS Access,
SQL Server, MySQL)
* To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
* To use SQL to get the data you want
* To use HTML/CSS to style the page

RDBMS
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server,
IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.

The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables, A table is collection
of related data entries and it consistes of columns and rows.

Look at the "Customers" table:
Examples:
SELECT * FROM Customers;

Every table is broken up into smaller entities called fields. The fields in the
Customers table consist of CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City
PostalCode and Country. A field is a column in a table that is designed to maintain
specific information about every record in the table.

A reacor, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table.
For example, there are 91 records in the above Customers table. A record is horizontal
entity in a table.

A column is vertical entiry in a table that contains all information associated with
a specific field in a table.

SQL syntax
Database Tables

Database Tables
A database most often contains one or more tables, Each table is identified by a name
(e.g. "Customers" or "Orders"). Tables contain records(rows) whith data.

In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database(included in MS Access
and MS SQL Server).

Below is a selection from the "Customers" table:
...


SQL Statements
Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are donw with SQL statements.
The following SQL statement select all the records in the "Customers" table:

SELECT * FROM Customers;
In this tutorial we will teach you all about the different SQL statements.

Keep in Mind That...
SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT

In this tutorial we will write all SQL keywords in upper-case.

Semicolon after SQL Statements?
Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow
more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

In this tutorial , we will use semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

Some of the Most important SQL Commands
SELECT -extracts data from a database
UPDATE -updates data in a database
DELETE -deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO -insert new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE -create a new database
ALTER DATABASE -modifies a database
CREATE TABLE -create a new table
ALTER TABLE -modifies a table
DROP TABLE -deletes a table
CREATE INDEX -creates an index(search key)
DROP INDEX -deletes an index


SELECT DISTINCT column1, colum2, ... FROM table_name;
SELECT Country FROM Customers;
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;

Here is the workaround for MS Access:
Examples
SELECT Count(*) AS DistinctCountries
FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);

SQL WHERE Clause
The SQL WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
The WHERE clause is used to extract only those records
that fulfill a specified condition.

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Note:The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statement,
it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE statement, etc.!

The following SQL statement selects all the customers from
the country "Mexico", in the "Customers" table:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Mexico';

Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields
SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database 
systems will also allow double quotes).
However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID=1;

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City="Berlin";

SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators
The SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators
The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.
The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than
one condition:

https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_and_or.asp

AND Syntax
SELECT column1,column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;

OR Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

NOT Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany' AND City='Berlin';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Berlin' OR City='M乶chen';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Berlin' OR Country='M乶chen';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country='Germany';

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City='Berlin' OR City='M乶chen');

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country='Germany' AND NOT Country='USA';


SQL ORDER BY Keyword
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_orderby.asp

The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or
descending order.

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default.
To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

ORDER BY Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, colum2, ... ASC|DESC;

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country;

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country DESC;

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;

SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

INSERT INTO Customers (CustomersName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006','Norway');

SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;


UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;

DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName = 'Alfreds';

DELETE FROM table_name;
